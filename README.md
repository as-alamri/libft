# libft
In this project we must recode a set of functions from the libc, They must comply with the way they are defined in their man and have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. we will create our own library. It will be helpful since we will use it in our next C assignments.

# Functions from <ctype.h> library

ft_isascii - test for ASCII character.

ft_isalnum - alphanumeric character test.

ft_isalpha - alphabetic character test.

ft_islower * - lower-case character test.

ft_isupper * - upper-case character test.

ft_isdigit - decimal-digit character test.

ft_isxdigit * - hexadecimal-digit character test.

ft_isprint - printing character test (space character inclusive).

ft_isgraph * - printing character test (space character exclusive).

ft_isspace * - white-space character test.

ft_isblank * - space or tab character test.

ft_ispunct * - punctuation character test.

ft_iscntrl * - control character test.

ft_tolower - upper case to lower case letter conversion.

ft_toupper - lower case to upper case letter conversion.

# Functions from <stdlib.h> library

ft_atoi - convert ASCII string to integer.

ft_atof * - convert ASCII string to integer.

ft_calloc - memory allocation.

# Functions from <strings.h> library

ft_bzero - write zeroes to a byte string.
